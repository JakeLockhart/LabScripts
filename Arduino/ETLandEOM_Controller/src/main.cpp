#include <Arduino.h>
//  This script is designed to control both the ETL and the EOM (Pockel Cell) in response to TTL pulses.
//      Parameters:
//          - Total imaging planes
//          - .txt file of R2P power measurement
//      Goal
//          - Create Gardasoft Code in resposne to total imaging planes & their respective depths
//          - Use .txt file as a reference to interpolate voltage/laser intensity at a specific imaging depth
//          - Adjust the ETL in response to a TTL pulse
//          - Adjust the EOM in response to a TTL pulse to match new focal depth(s)
