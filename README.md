Scripts for Drew Lab by Jake Lockhart

## Arduino
- **ETLController_SG**: Control the imaging plane of the electric tuneable lens based on a TTL pulse. Created by S. Garborg.
- **ETLandEOM_Controller-DUE**: Control both the electric tuneable lens and electric optic modulator via an Arduino Due to modulate laser intensity & imaging depth simultaneously.  

## Functions
- **Zap**: Clear window and close all figures  

## MDF File Postprocessing
- **VesselDiameter_TimeLag**: Cross-correlation of two imaging planes based on a .txt file containing vessel diameter over time  

## MDF File Preprocessing
- **ParameterFigure**: Initialize parameters for preprocessing .MDF files  

## Two-Photon Microscope
- **PowerMeasurement**: Collect and process the two-photon microscope's laser intensity
